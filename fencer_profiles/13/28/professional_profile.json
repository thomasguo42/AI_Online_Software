    "synopsis": "Andrea Sayson demonstrates a predominantly reactive tactical style, heavily reliant on defensive positioning. Her most prominent strength, though not yet proven in scoring, appears to be maintaining distance, as evidenced by her Defense Distance Management. However, her most significant weakness lies in a critical lack of offensive initiative and an inability to convert defensive situations into points, resulting in a 0.0% defense scoring rate. Consequently, her recent performance trend indicates a need for immediate development in offensive aggression and defensive effectiveness to achieve competitive readiness.",

Prioritize drills that focus on safely and efficiently closing distance to initiate attacks within the box, as this is a currently unexploited area."
