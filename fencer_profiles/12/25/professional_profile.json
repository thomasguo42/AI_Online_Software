    "synopsis": "Rui Guo exhibits an aggressive, initiative-taking tactical style, consistently seeking to dictate the pace of the bout. Their most prominent strength lies in dominance during simultaneous engagements (Inbox), where they achieve a perfect scoring rate. However, a significant weakness is a systemic defensive vulnerability, evidenced by a zero percent scoring rate in defensive situations. Rui Guo's recent performance trend shows a strong offensive capability but a clear need for immediate improvement in defensive execution and counter-attack effectiveness.",

The data shows a 0.0% win rate in defense and a significant weakness in \"missed counter-opportunities\" (2 occurrences), indicating a critical need to convert these defensive moments into offensive actions.\n\n*   **Improve Acceleration and Speed:** Implement interval training and explosive footwork drills to address the consistent \"poor acceleration\" (5 occurrences in \"in_box\", 2 in \"defense\") and \"low speed\" (2 occurrences in \"defense\"). This will improve offensive explosiveness and defensive responsiveness.\n\n*   **Refine Attack Timing and Predictability:** Incorporate practice sessions that emphasize unpredictable attack initiation and varied tempo changes. The data highlights \"countered on preparation (timing error)\" as a primary loss reason in attacks, suggesting opponents are exploiting predictable patterns."
