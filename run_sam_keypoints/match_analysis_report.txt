DETAILED TACTICAL ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Attack Priority (+4 points for right fencer):
   The right fencer initiated their attack first at 0.433s, establishing attack priority 133 milliseconds before the left fencer (who attacked at 0.567s). In fencing, the fencer who attacks first has right-of-way and priority.

   The left fencer showed significantly more hesitation with 31.7% pause time (0.67s) compared to the right fencer's 14.3% pause time (0.30s). This 17.5% difference indicates the right fencer maintained more consistent offensive pressure throughout the action.

3. Extension at Contact (+3 points for left fencer):
   At the critical moment of closest approach (1.83s), the left fencer had superior arm extension (72.7 pixels) compared to the right fencer (57.8 pixels), a difference of 15.0 pixels. This indicates the left fencer's weapon was more fully extended during the scoring opportunity.

4. Athletic Execution (+1 point for left fencer):
   The left fencer displayed superior explosive speed with a maximum velocity of 497.4 pixels/second, significantly higher than the right fencer's 389.6 pixels/second, indicating more explosive athletic execution.

REFEREE INTERPRETATION AND JUSTIFICATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The right fencer is awarded the point based on superior tactical execution. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the right fencer established attack priority through earlier initiation timing, maintained better offensive pressure with significantly less hesitation, and achieved superior arm extension at the critical moment of engagement. The 133 millisecond advantage in attack initiation gave the right fencer unambiguous right-of-way. These factors combine to create a decisive tactical advantage that warrants awarding the point to the right fencer with 60.0% confidence.

                                        OVERALL MATCH SUMMARY
====================================================================================================

FINAL RESULTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Match 1 (Video 3809): RIGHT FENCER wins the point (Confidence: 60.0%)
Match 2 (Video 3810): LEFT FENCER wins the point (Confidence: 71.4%)

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This comprehensive analysis employs advanced computer vision and biomechanical tracking
to objectively assess fencing actions. The system evaluates multiple critical factors:

1. ATTACK PRIORITY (Highest Weight - 4 points):
   The fencer who initiates their attack first establishes right-of-way according to
   fencing rules. Attack initiation is determined by the moment when arm extension
   begins to increase significantly above baseline, indicating the start of an
   offensive action. Timing precision down to individual frames (33ms intervals).

2. TACTICAL AGGRESSION (2 points):
   Measured by pause time analysis. Fencers who maintain continuous forward pressure
   and minimize hesitation demonstrate superior tactical control and offensive intent.
   Pause time is calculated as periods where movement speed drops below 50 pixels/second.

3. ARM EXTENSION AT CONTACT (3 points):
   At the moment of closest approach between fencers, the competitor with greater
   arm extension has their weapon positioned to score. This is measured as the
   shoulder-to-wrist distance at the critical frame.

4. MAXIMUM ARM EXTENSION (1 point):
   The ability to achieve full arm extension during a lunge indicates superior
   reach, technique, and offensive capability.

5. EXPLOSIVE SPEED (1 point):
   Peak movement velocity demonstrates athletic ability and the capacity for
   surprise attacks. Measured in pixels per second of total movement.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• This analysis is based purely on biomechanical movement data extracted from video.
• The system cannot detect actual blade contact, touches, or weapon interactions.
• Fencing-specific rules such as right-of-way in foil/sabre, valid target areas,
  and blade priority are approximated through movement analysis.
• This analysis should be used as a supplementary tool in conjunction with
  human referee judgment and video review.
• All distance measurements are in pixels and depend on camera positioning.
• The system assumes both fencers are attempting to score and does not account
  for defensive actions, feints, or tactical retreats.
